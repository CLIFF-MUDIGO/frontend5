## Project Description
Welcome to our AI-powered web app, where cutting-edge technology meets the world of news analysis. At the heart of our platform lies the transformative power of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a groundbreaking field that enables us to delve into the intricate nuances of news articles like never before.
With a commitment to harnessing the capabilities of AI, we have crafted a user-friendly interface that allows you to effortlessly navigate through news stories while our advanced NLP algorithms work tirelessly
in the background.
Our app's primary focus is on sentiment analysis, a pivotal aspect of news comprehension. By employing NLP,we decipher the emotions, opinions, and attitudes woven into the fabric of articles, shedding light on the
underlying sentiment and providing you with a deeper understanding of the narratives shaping our world.
